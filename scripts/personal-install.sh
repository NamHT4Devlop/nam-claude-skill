# personal-install.sh — install for YOUR user only (zero footprint in any repo).
#
# Symlinks this repo's skills/agents/commands into ~/.claude so they're available in every
# project but live only in your home dir — never inside (or committed to) a project repo.
# Skills/agents are named `namht-*`. Command files are unprefixed in the repo (so the plugin
# form is clean: /namht:build); this installer symlinks them WITH a `namht-` prefix, so the
# personal form is /namht-build, /namht-ask, … (won't shadow built-ins like /help).
# Symlinks mean `git pull` here instantly updates you.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/personal-install.sh            # install / refresh (idempotent)
#   scripts/personal-install.sh uninstall  # remove only the symlinks pointing back here
#
# Pick ONE install method — if you use this, do NOT also `/plugin install` the same plugin.
