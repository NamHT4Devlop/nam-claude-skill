# kb-import.sh — the other half of kb-export.sh: drop a project's KB from the hub into a local
# checkout, so a teammate gets the same Knowledge Base the commands read.
#
#   scripts/kb-import.sh <hub-dir> <project> [target-repo]     (target defaults to the current dir)
#   scripts/kb-import.sh --dry-run ~/kb-hub taskflow ~/work/taskflow
#   scripts/kb-import.sh --force   ~/kb-hub taskflow           (replace an existing KB)
#
# Safety: it never silently replaces an existing knowledge-base/. Without --force it stops and shows
# you what differs. It also warns when the snapshot was taken from a commit your checkout does not
# have — a KB describing code you are not on is worse than no KB, because it reads as current.
