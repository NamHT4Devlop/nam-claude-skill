# ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE POINTING IT AT A COMPANY REPO
# A Knowledge Base is a distilled description of your source: business rules, data model, auth model,
# endpoints. It is DERIVED FROM the code and is often more sensitive per page than the code itself,
# because it is the readable version. The hub repo must be **private** and shared only with people
# who already have access to those repos. This script checks GitHub visibility when it can, refuses
# to write into a repo it can see is public, and NEVER pushes — you review and push yourself.
