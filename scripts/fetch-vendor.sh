# fetch-vendor.sh — obtain the vendored render libraries instead of copying 3.6 MB by hand.
#
# Why they exist: generated HTML reports inline Mermaid/Cytoscape so a diagram renders with NO
# network call at view time. Without vendor/ the HTML falls back to a cdnjs <script> — fine on a
# machine with open internet, broken behind a proxy that blocks CDNs.
#
# Order of preference (most policy-friendly first):
#   1. npm  — respects the registry in your .npmrc, so on a company machine this pulls from the
#             internal mirror/Artifactory your org already vets. Verified byte-identical to cdnjs.
#   2. curl — direct from cdnjs, for machines without npm.
# Whatever the source, every file is checked against vendor/SHA256SUMS before it is installed:
# a mismatch aborts rather than silently trusting the download.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/fetch-vendor.sh            # fetch what's missing, verify, install
#   scripts/fetch-vendor.sh --check    # verify what's already there, change nothing
#   scripts/fetch-vendor.sh --force    # re-fetch even if present

✖ Some libraries are missing. The toolkit still works — generated HTML will simply link
  Mermaid/Cytoscape from cdnjs, which needs internet when you OPEN the report. If this machine is
  behind a proxy that blocks CDNs, copy vendor/*.min.js from a machine that has them, then run
  scripts/fetch-vendor.sh --check to confirm the hashes.
