description: Behavior-preserving simplification — reduce complexity/duplication/nesting, improve clarity, tests stay green
argument-hint: "[file/function/module to simplify | empty = current diff]"
---

Use the **namht-simplify** skill to reduce complexity and improve clarity of the target **without
changing behavior**: remove dead code, flatten nesting (guard clauses), extract/rename for
readability, kill duplication, drop needless abstraction — one small refactor at a time, keeping
tests green after each. If a bug surfaces, stop and flag it (don't change behavior). Change-discipline.
