# namht Kit for Claude Code

A native **Claude Code** port of the private Auto Spec extension VS Code
extension. Same spec-driven workflow — **Requirement → Plan → Code → Review → Test →
Evidence** — plus Knowledge Base generation, codebase Q&A, user stories, dependency mapping,
and business↔code documentation. The difference: it runs on **Claude Code** (your own
tools: file ops, Bash, git, parallel sub-agents) instead of GitHub Copilot / `vscode.lm`.

> **Your existing Knowledge Bases work as-is.** The KBs you generated with the old extension
> are plain Markdown under each repo's `knowledge-base/`. Every command here reads that same
> folder — nothing to migrate or regenerate. Only run `/namht-scan` for brand-new repos.

Commands are thin entry points; the **skills** hold the actual methodology and auto-activate
from natural language too (you don't have to type the slash command). The **agents** are the
read-only specialists the build/review steps fan out to in parallel.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed and working (`claude --version`). Plugins/marketplaces need a
  recent version — if `/plugin` is unknown, update Claude Code first (`claude update` or
  reinstall from the official docs).
- **git** installed (`git --version`) — needed to clone this repo and used by `rescan`/`review`.
- **Access to this repository.** It is **public**, so anyone can clone it — no special access
  needed. The plugin itself needs **no API key** — it runs on your existing Claude Code.
- Paths below use `~/.claude` (macOS/Linux). On **Windows** use `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`
  (PowerShell: `$HOME\.claude`).
- **Windows, read this first.** Option A (plugin) works natively — it is all typed inside
  Claude Code. The shell scripts in `scripts/` and the `hooks/git-guard.sh` hook are **bash**,
  so they need **Git Bash** (ships with Git for Windows) or **WSL**. If you want a pure
  PowerShell install, use **Option B** below — it is plain file copying and needs no bash.
  There is no PowerShell port of `personal-install.sh`: it creates symlinks and merges
  `settings.json`, and shipping an untested installer for a platform I cannot test on would be
  worse than telling you this plainly.

---

## Get the code

Pick a stable location to keep the plugin (so you can update it with `git pull` later):

```bash
# via SSH (recommended if your GitHub uses SSH keys)
git clone git@github.com:NamHT4Devlop/nam-claude-skill.git ~/nam-claude-skill

# or via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/NamHT4Devlop/nam-claude-skill.git ~/nam-claude-skill
```

Everywhere below, `<PLUGIN_DIR>` means the folder you cloned into (e.g. `~/nam-claude-skill`).
If you keep the files somewhere else, substitute that absolute path.

---

## Install — Option A: as a plugin (recommended)

Best when you want every command available across **all** your repos on a machine, with clean
`/namht:*` namespacing. Run these **inside a Claude Code session** (the `/plugin`
commands are typed into Claude Code, not your shell):

```
/plugin marketplace add ~/nam-claude-skill
/plugin install namht@namht-marketplace
```

- `marketplace add <PLUGIN_DIR>` registers the local marketplace defined in
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. You can also point it straight at the GitHub repo:
  `/plugin marketplace add NamHT4Devlop/nam-claude-skill` (Claude Code clones it for you; requires
  repo access).
- `install namht@namht-marketplace` installs the plugin named `namht` from that
  marketplace.
- Reload when prompted (or run `/plugin` to manage installed plugins).

After install, commands are namespaced by the plugin (type `/` to see them):
`/namht:scan`, `/namht:rescan`, `/namht:build`, `/namht:fix-bug`, `/namht:review`, `/namht:ask`,
`/namht:plan`, `/namht:map`, `/namht:system-map`, `/namht:document`, `/namht:help`.
The 30 skills and 7 sub-agents load automatically (skills also activate from plain English), and the
**git-guard hook ships with the plugin** (`hooks/hooks.json`) so it's active right after install.
(The personal symlink install — Option C — exposes the same commands as `/namht-build`, etc.)

> **Team install:** commit/host this repo, then each teammate runs the two `/plugin` commands
> above pointing at their clone (or at `NamHT4Devlop/nam-claude-skill`). To pin the plugin for a
> whole project automatically, add it to the project's `.claude/settings.json` under
> `enabledPlugins` / configure a marketplace there (see Claude Code plugin docs).

## Install — Option B: plain skills (no plugin machinery)

Best when you want to **commit the skills into a specific repo** (so collaborators get them on
clone), or you prefer not to use marketplaces.

**B1 — Per project** (only that repo gets the commands/skills):

```bash
# run from the target repo's root
mkdir -p .claude/skills .claude/commands .claude/agents
cp -R <PLUGIN_DIR>/skills/*   .claude/skills/
cp -R <PLUGIN_DIR>/commands/* .claude/commands/
cp -R <PLUGIN_DIR>/agents/*   .claude/agents/
```

**B2 — Per user** (all your repos on this machine):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/commands ~/.claude/agents
cp -R <PLUGIN_DIR>/skills/*   ~/.claude/skills/
cp -R <PLUGIN_DIR>/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -R <PLUGIN_DIR>/agents/*   ~/.claude/agents/
```

**B — on Windows (PowerShell, no bash needed):**

```powershell
# per project — run from the target repo's root
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .claude\skills, .claude\commands, .claude\agents | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force <PLUGIN_DIR>\skills\*   .claude\skills\
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force <PLUGIN_DIR>\commands\* .claude\commands\
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force <PLUGIN_DIR>\agents\*   .claude\agents\

# per user — same thing into $HOME\.claude
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $HOME\.claude\skills, $HOME\.claude\commands, $HOME\.claude\agents | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force <PLUGIN_DIR>\skills\*   $HOME\.claude\skills\
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force <PLUGIN_DIR>\commands\* $HOME\.claude\commands\
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force <PLUGIN_DIR>\agents\*   $HOME\.claude\agents\
```

> The **git-guard hook is not installed by this route** on any platform — Option A ships it with the
> plugin, Option C installs it via the script. On Windows without bash the hook cannot run at all;
> rely on Claude Code's own permission prompts instead, and know that is a weaker guarantee.

**You do NOT need to copy the plugin's `resources/` folder for Option B.** Each skill is
self-contained — it bundles whatever it needs under its own `references/` subfolder, which
comes along automatically with `cp -R skills/*`:
`namht-build`/`namht-review`/`namht-scan`/`namht-rescan` carry the review checklist and/or the
KB-section spec. `resources/` at the repo root is only a canonical copy for the plugin form.

> ⚠️ **Difference from Option A:** as plain skills the slash commands are **not** namespaced —
> they're `/build`, `/review`, `/scan`, etc. If those names clash with other commands you have,
> rename the files in `.claude/commands/` (e.g. `build.md` → `namht-build.md`).

## Install — Option C: personal-only, zero footprint in any repo (just for you)

Use this when the plugin/skills are **for your eyes only** and must never appear in — or be
committed to — any team/project repo. It installs into your home dir via symlinks and routes
all generated artifacts to a machine-wide gitignore.

```bash
# 1) symlink skills/agents/commands into ~/.claude (commands get a namht- prefix)
<PLUGIN_DIR>/scripts/personal-install.sh

# 2) make every namht Kit artifact invisible to git, machine-wide (no per-repo edits)
touch ~/.gitignore_global
printf '%s\n' 'namht-sessions/' 'spec-kit-sessions/' 'knowledge-base/' 'CLAUDE.local.md' >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

- Commands become `/namht-build`, `/namht-scan`, `/namht-review`, … (prefixed so they don't shadow
  built-ins like `/help`). Skills also auto-activate from plain English.
- Because it's symlinks, `git pull` in `<PLUGIN_DIR>` instantly updates your install.
- The global gitignore means even if you run `/namht-scan` inside a team repo, its
  `knowledge-base/` and `namht-sessions/` stay **local and uncommitted** — nothing leaks.
- **Pick ONE method** — if you use this, do *not* also `/plugin install` the same plugin.
- Uninstall: `<PLUGIN_DIR>/scripts/personal-install.sh uninstall`.

> Note: a global ignore of `knowledge-base/` keeps your KBs private. If a project legitimately
> needs a committed `knowledge-base/`, force-add it there with `git add -f knowledge-base/`.

---

## Verify the install

1. In a Claude Code session, type `/` and confirm the `namht:` commands (Option A) or
   `/build`, `/scan`… (Option B) appear.
2. Run `/namht-help` (or `/help` for plain skills) — it prints all commands **and** checks
   whether the current repo has a `knowledge-base/`.
3. Plugin only: run `/plugin` → you should see **namht** listed as installed/enabled.

## Update to the latest version

- **Option A (plugin):**
  ```bash
  cd <PLUGIN_DIR> && git pull
  ```
  then in Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace update namht-marketplace` (or remove & re-add
  the marketplace, then reinstall). Reload when prompted.
- **Option B (plain skills):** `git pull` in `<PLUGIN_DIR>`, then re-run the `cp -R` commands
  to overwrite the copies.

## Uninstall

- **Option A:** `/plugin uninstall namht` (and optionally
  `/plugin marketplace remove namht-marketplace`).
- **Option B:** delete the copied folders, e.g.
  run `<PLUGIN_DIR>/scripts/personal-install.sh uninstall` (removes only the symlinks that point back to this repo).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `/plugin` is not recognized | Update Claude Code; plugins require a recent version. |
| `marketplace add` fails on a path | Pass an **absolute** path to `<PLUGIN_DIR>` and ensure `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists there. |
| `git clone` asks for a password / permission denied | The repo is public — clone the HTTPS URL (no auth needed), or set up an SSH key for the `git@` URL. |
| Commands don't show up | Reload the Claude Code window/session after install; for plain skills, confirm files landed in `.claude/commands` & `.claude/skills`. |
| A command says "no knowledge-base found" | Run `/namht-scan` once in that repo (or reuse an existing `knowledge-base/` folder). |
| Command name clash (Option B) | Rename the files in `.claude/commands/`. |

---

## Recommended setup for a multi-project workspace

If you keep many repos under one parent folder (a "workspace"), follow this separation:

- **Tool = global, from git.** Install once as a plugin (Option A). Update everywhere with one
  `git pull` + marketplace update. Don't copy skills into each repo.
- **Knowledge Base = per project, versioned with the code.** Each repo keeps its own
  `knowledge-base/`; commit it so the team shares it. Refresh with `/namht-rescan`.
- **Operate one project per session.** `cd <project> && claude` so commands read *that*
  project's `knowledge-base/`. The parent workspace is just an organizing folder — don't run
  from the workspace root and expect commands to guess which sub-project you mean. (A true
  **monorepo** — one git repo, many packages — is the opposite: run at the repo root; `scan`
  produces per-module docs under `knowledge-base/modules/`.)
- **Per-project hygiene** — gitignore the generated `namht-sessions/`, and drop a short
  `CLAUDE.md` so every session in that repo knows the KB exists. Automate it:

  ```bash
  # from your clone of this repo
  scripts/onboard-project.sh /path/to/your/project   # idempotent; commits nothing
  ```

  It adds `namht-sessions/` to `.gitignore`, creates a starter `CLAUDE.md` (only if absent),
  and reports whether the project has a KB yet (→ run `/namht-scan` if not).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/namht-scan` | Generate the Knowledge Base from the codebase (16 docs + `review-skills.md` + per-module docs). Run first on a new repo. |
| `/namht-rescan` | Update the KB incrementally after code changes (git-diff aware). |
| `/namht-build <requirement>` | 13-step pipeline: clarify → plan (impact + business flow) → code → multi-lens review → tests → run tests → evidence → update KB. |
| `/namht-fix-bug <error/stack trace>` | Production hotfix: triage → locate (read the code) → root-cause → failing regression test → minimal surgical fix → verify (tests+build, rollback) → hotfix report + KB update. Does not deploy. |
| `/namht-review [file\|PR#]` | Two-phase review: quality checklist + business consistency vs the KB. Empty arg = current branch vs the default branch (or working-tree diff if uncommitted); accepts a PR #/URL (`gh pr diff`). |
| `/namht-ask <question>` | Q&A grounded in the KB — plain language + Mermaid diagram + technical detail. |
| `/namht-plan <epic>` | PO/BA: Epic → features → impact → user stories (Given/When/Then) → sprint plan. |
| `/namht-issues [plan] [target] [--create]` | Turn a plan / user stories into real tracker issues — GitHub via `gh`, Jira/Linear via a connected MCP. One issue per story, ACs as a checklist, ids kept so re-runs update instead of duplicating. Preview-by-default; creating needs an explicit yes. |
| `/namht-qa <user story>` | QA: user story → test cases covering the **NEW flow + regression for OLD business flows** (Gherkin + manual table + AC↔case traceability). Designs tests; doesn't code them. |
| `/namht-pr [review <PR#>]` | Prepare a PR description from the current branch, or review a GitHub PR (`gh pr diff` → two-phase review + blast radius). Read-only on the remote. |
| `/namht-security-audit [scope]` | Whole-repo security audit: attack surface + injection/authz/IDOR/secrets/exposure/AI, grounded in the KB, with severities + fixes. Read-only. |
| `/namht-drift [scope] [--fix-docs]` | Docs-vs-reality audit of the whole repo: stale KB entries, undocumented behavior, acceptance criteria promised but never shipped, broken architecture invariants. Read-only by default and routes each finding to rescan/build/review; `--fix-docs` additionally offers to refresh the stale **docs** (never source). See [Keeping docs and code from drifting apart](#keeping-docs-and-code-from-drifting-apart). |
| `/namht-map [scope]` | Interactive HTML code graph (Cytoscape): files/classes + imports/DI/inheritance/calls; zoom, click, filter, search. Opens in browser. |
| `/namht-system-map` | **Cross-service** map for a multi-repo microservices workspace: stitches each service's API/integrations into a dependency graph + end-to-end flows (sequence diagrams) + contracts/events + risks. Run at the workspace root. |
| `/namht-document <topic>` | Business↔code field-level technical document for a feature/entity/module. |
| `/namht-discover <idea>` | Discovery before planning: forcing questions, push back on framing, output a sharpened problem brief. |
| `/namht-plan-review <plan>` | Critique a plan before building — Product / Architecture / Risk-QA / DevEx lenses + verdict. |
| `/namht-qa-integration <url>` | Execute E2E/integration QA against a **running app** via a real browser (Claude-in-Chrome); pass/fail + screenshots. |
| `/namht-design-review <url\|path>` | UI/UX + accessibility review via browser screenshots / frontend code; findings + fixes. Read-only. |
| `/namht-pdf <file>` | Export a Markdown/HTML report to PDF (renders Mermaid first; headless Chrome/wkhtmltopdf). |
| `/namht-retro [window]` | Engineering retrospective from git history — shipped, pain, quality signals, action items. |
| `/namht-runbook [service]` | Turn the KB + the repo's real deploy/CI/error-handling config into an **operational runbook**: health checks, deploy and rollback (incl. what rollback does *not* undo), symptom→fix incident playbooks, alerts→action, data recovery. Marks what only a human knows instead of inventing it. |
| `/namht-skillify <name+purpose>` | Scaffold a new `namht-*` skill + command following the conventions (self-extend the kit). |
| `/namht-splunk-report [apps + window]` | Query Splunk for per-app errors over a window (default today), aggregate into one table, and post it to Slack. Read-only on Splunk; credentials from env/MCP, never hardcoded. Needs network. |
| `/namht-user-story <requirement or Slack link>` | Deep-investigate a requirement (or comprehend a Slack thread) → features + INVEST user stories with maximally granular Given/When/Then ACs. |
| `/namht-rails-to-spring <endpoint set>` | Contract-first port to another stack (e.g. Rails+GraphQL → Spring Boot/MyBatis) — golden-test parity per endpoint, strangler cutover. Edits code. |
| `/namht-observe [area]` | Instrument code for observability — structured logs, correlation/trace IDs (HTTP + SQS), metrics, error context; matches the backend field schema. Edits code. |
| `/namht-migrate [change]` | Plan + execute a safe migration/deprecation (API, DB schema, event contract, library) — backward-compatible, staged, with a rollback per step + deprecation window. |
| `/namht-simplify [target]` | Behavior-preserving simplification — remove dead code, flatten nesting, extract/rename, kill duplication; one refactor at a time, tests stay green. |
| `/namht-perf [area]` | Measure-first performance optimization — N+1, indexes, blocking calls, caching, pagination; proves the win with before/after numbers. |
| `/namht-help` | Show all commands + KB status for the current repo. |

**Recommended flow:** `discover` → `plan` → `plan-review` → `qa` (design tests) → `build` →
`qa-integration` (run them) → `review`/`security-audit` → `pr`. Run `scan` once first; `rescan` to
keep the KB fresh, and `drift` every so often to find what `rescan` never heard about.

---

## Keeping docs and code from drifting apart

Every other command works **one change at a time**. `/namht-build` updates the KB for what it just
touched, `/namht-rescan` updates it for what git shows changed. Neither catches the slow rot: a
hotfix applied by hand, a colleague's merge, a feature that was planned and quietly never built, an
architecture rule broken once "just for now". After a few months the Knowledge Base is confidently
describing software that no longer exists — and every answer built on it is wrong.

`/namht-drift` is the periodic check for exactly that. It audits the whole repo and reports four
kinds of drift:

| | Drift | Question it answers | Fix route |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Stale doc | The KB describes something the code no longer does | `/namht-rescan` |
| **D2** | Undocumented code | Real behavior no document mentions | `/namht-rescan` |
| **D3** | Unbuilt promise | An AC from a story/plan in `namht-sessions/` that never shipped | `/namht-build` |
| **D4** | Broken invariant | Code violates the documented "DO NOT BREAK" rules | `/namht-review` |

Each finding must cite **`file:line` on one side and the document line on the other**, and state
**which side is wrong** — sub-agents only produce leads; the skill re-verifies every one against the
source before it appears in the report. It ends with a verdict (`CONVERGED` / `DRIFTING` / `STALE`)
and appends a row to `namht-sessions/drift/_journal.md`, so successive runs show whether drift is
growing or shrinking.

**When to run it**

| Moment | Why |
|---|---|
| Before a release or a handover | This is when a wrong document does real damage |
| After a stretch of rushed work (crunch sprint, incident firefighting) | Exactly when drift is created |
| Every ~month, or at each sprint boundary | The journal turns it into a trend instead of a snapshot |
| Before onboarding someone new | They will trust the KB; a wrong KB teaches them the wrong system |
| When `/namht-ask` starts answering *almost* right | That is the symptom of a KB going stale |
| Before a large port or migration | Porting from wrong docs copies the mistake into the new stack |

You don't need it after every task — `/namht-build` already keeps its own footprint documented.

### `--fix-docs` — the one thing it will fix for you

By default `/namht-drift` **changes nothing**: it reports and hands off. With `--fix-docs` it also
offers to close the documentation half of the drift:

```bash
claude "/namht-drift --fix-docs"
```

What that mode will and will not do:

- ✅ Only **D1/D2** findings where the audit concluded **the document** was wrong.
- ✅ Shows the findings and the exact `knowledge-base/` files first, and needs **one explicit yes**
  — a "go" in your original request does not count, because you have not seen the findings yet.
- ✅ **Backs those KB files up** to `namht-sessions/drift/<date>-kb-backup/` before anything is
  written. `knowledge-base/` is normally gitignored, so git is *not* your undo here.
- ✅ Delegates the actual writing to `/namht-rescan` (one owner for KB writes), then **re-verifies**
  each fixed claim and reports what it could not confirm.
- ❌ Never edits **source code** — in any mode, with any flag. That is `/namht-build`'s job.
- ❌ Never auto-resolves **D3** (writing an unbuilt AC into the docs as if shipped) or **D4**
  (relaxing a documented invariant to match the code). Rewriting the rule to match the violation is
  precisely the failure this command exists to catch.
- ❌ Refuses surgical patching when the verdict is `STALE` — a KB that broadly stopped matching the
  codebase needs a full `/namht-rescan`, not fifty patches.

The reason it stops there: when a doc and the code disagree, **you do not yet know which one is
wrong**. Sometimes the doc lags. Sometimes the doc is the agreed intent and the code is the bug.
Auto-rewriting the doc to match the code would turn that bug into "the new spec" and delete the
evidence that anything was ever wrong.

---

## Many repos: telling KBs apart, and sharing them with the team

`knowledge-base/` is called the same thing in every repo. Inside one repo that is fine — it is
unambiguous, every command looks for exactly that path, and renaming it per project would break your
existing KBs, the machine-wide ignore, and every skill at once. The name only becomes a problem the
moment KBs from several projects sit **side by side**. So the fix is not a folder name, it is
**identity inside the KB plus a namespace at collection time**.

**1. Every KB now says who it is.** `/namht-scan` and `/namht-rescan` write
`knowledge-base/_meta.yml`:

```yaml
project: taskflow
repo: git@github.com:acme/taskflow.git
branch: main
commit: 9f2c1ab        # the KB describes THIS revision
generated: 2026-08-13
depth: standard
modules: [auth, orders, billing]
```

`rescan` refreshes `commit`/`generated` — a KB whose meta points at a three-month-old commit is the
one that gets trusted as current. Per-module docs already carry their own name
(`knowledge-base/modules/<module>.md`).

**2. Collect them into one hub repo, namespaced by project:**

```bash
scripts/kb-export.sh ~/kb-hub ~/work/taskflow ~/work/billing ~/work/gateway
```

```
kb-hub/
├── README.md                                  # index: project · branch · commit · exported · files
└── projects/
    ├── taskflow/{_meta.yml, knowledge-base/…}
    ├── billing/{_meta.yml, knowledge-base/…}
    └── gateway/{_meta.yml, knowledge-base/…}
```

Each folder is a **snapshot**, not a live mirror — re-export after a rescan. If a KB predates
`_meta.yml`, the export synthesises its identity from git. Re-exporting replaces a project's
snapshot rather than merging, so a file deleted upstream disappears here too. The script **never
commits or pushes** — you review it yourself.

**3. A teammate pulls the hub and drops one in:**

```bash
scripts/kb-import.sh ~/kb-hub taskflow ~/work/taskflow
```

It refuses to overwrite an existing `knowledge-base/` (use `--force`, which keeps a timestamped
backup — remember `knowledge-base/` is gitignored, so git will not save you), and it warns when the
snapshot's commit is not in that checkout, which usually means the wrong repo.

> ⚠️ **Keep the hub repo private.** A Knowledge Base is a readable distillation of your source:
> business rules, data model, auth model, endpoints. Page for page it is often *more* sensitive than
> the code, and it is far easier to read. `kb-export.sh` refuses to write into a repo it can see is
> public (via `gh`), but that check is a backstop, not a policy — share it only with people who
> already have access to the repos it came from.

---

## Running a skill on a schedule

Two skills are genuinely periodic — the Splunk error digest, and keeping a Knowledge Base fresh —
and `/namht-drift` is worth a monthly run. `scripts/schedule.sh` wires them to cron:

```bash
scripts/schedule.sh add rescan "0 7 * * 1"  ~/work/my-repo          # Mondays 07:00
scripts/schedule.sh add drift  "0 8 1 * *"  ~/work/my-repo          # 1st of the month
scripts/schedule.sh add splunk "30 8 * * *" ~/work/my-repo -- "index=app_logs cai_enviroment=prod 24h"
scripts/schedule.sh list
scripts/schedule.sh remove rescan ~/work/my-repo
```

It edits a persistent system setting, so it is deliberately careful: every line it writes carries a
`# namht-kit:<preset>:<repo>` marker and it only ever adds or removes **its own** lines; it prints
the exact change and asks before writing (`--dry-run` to just look, `--yes` to skip the prompt); and
it **refuses to schedule any skill that edits code** — an unattended source change should not be
something you can set up by accident. Output goes to `~/.claude/logs/namht-<preset>.log`. Note that
an unattended run cannot answer a permission prompt, so a skill that needs one simply fails in the
log rather than hanging.

## Security & enterprise

See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for the full audit. In short:
- Executable code is **pure local** (`fs`/`path`/`crypto`) — no shell exec, `eval`, dynamic
  `require`, network calls, or secrets. Safe to copy to a company machine.
- **Offline HTML:** with `vendor/` (Mermaid + Cytoscape, bundled) the generated HTML inlines the
  chart libs → **zero external network calls** (air-gapped / strict-proxy safe). Delete `vendor/`
  to get smaller CDN-linked output instead.
- **Change discipline** is built into `namht-build`/`namht-review`: scope-locked, minimal diff,
  no drive-by refactors, verify-and-rollback (don't leave the build broken), confirm before
  destructive/outward actions, never touch secrets.
- **Git guardrail (hard-enforced):** a PreToolUse hook (`hooks/git-guard.sh`) + `permissions.deny`
  allow read/sync-in git (fetch, pull, status, log, diff, show, blame, add, commit, …) **plus
  `push` only to a whitelisted personal remote** (`ALLOW_OWNER_RE`, default `NamHT4Devlop/*`).
  It **blocks** push to any other (team/org) remote, all remote-config mutation, and destructive
  local git (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `checkout --`, `rebase`, `branch -D`, …) — even in chained
  commands. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#git-guardrail-hard-blocked-readsync-in-only).
- The real data-egress is the AI agent reading code (inherent to any AI assistant), fine under a
  company **Team/Enterprise** Claude plan. `knowledge-base/` and `namht-sessions/`
  are gitignored machine-wide.

## How this maps to the original extension

| Auto Spec extension (VS Code + Copilot) | namht Kit for Claude Code |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `vscode.lm` calls to Copilot | Claude Code itself (no external API key) |
| `agent-orchestrator` parallel sub-agents | `Task` tool fan-out to the `agents/` specialists |
| Emits ```### FILE:``` code blocks to copy | Applies changes directly with Edit/Write |
| `testCommand` run by the extension | `Bash` runs the project's test command |
| Session outputs in `namht-sessions/` | Same — artifacts saved per run |
| `knowledge-base/` (16 docs + review-skills + modules) | **Identical format — reused as-is** |
| Webview HTML (ask/plan/document) | Markdown + Mermaid; **`map` = interactive Cytoscape HTML** (bundled analyzer) |

### Not ported (and why)
- The VS Code UI bits (Quick Picks, webviews, keybindings, output channel) — Claude Code is
  the UI now. Q&A/plans/docs are returned as Markdown + Mermaid; ask for HTML if you want it.
- Token-budget/throttling/checkpoint-resume plumbing — Claude Code manages context and tools
  natively, so the methodology is preserved without the bespoke machinery.

## Notes
- Every command degrades gracefully if a repo has no `knowledge-base/` — it'll read source
  directly and suggest running `/namht-scan`, but results are richer with a KB.
- `build` and `review` enforce the **"Architecture Invariants — DO NOT BREAK"** list from
  `knowledge-base/16-architecture-patterns.md` and the rules in `knowledge-base/review-skills.md`.
- Source of truth for the methodology: the original prompts of the private Auto Spec extension VS Code
  extension (pipeline steps, its `kb-steps` constants, and `review-skills-universal.md`).
- **Slash-command prefix depends on install method:** `/namht-build` (personal symlink install) vs
  `/namht:build` (plugin install) vs `/build` (plain copy). Skills also auto-activate from plain English.
- **Licensing:** MIT — except `vscode-extension/`, which is proprietary (see `vscode-extension/LICENSE`).
