description: >-
  Produce an operational runbook a teammate can follow at 2am — health checks,
  deploy and rollback, symptom→diagnosis→fix playbooks for the failures this
  system actually has, alert-to-action mapping, data recovery (migrations, DLQ
  replay), and escalation. Grounded in the Knowledge Base, the real deploy/CI
  config and the error handling in the code; anything only a human knows is
  marked as a gap, never invented. Use when the user says "/runbook", "make a
  runbook", "on-call guide", "operations doc", "what do we do when X breaks",
  or wants the KB turned into something the team can operate from.

# namht-runbook — turn the Knowledge Base into something you can act on at 2am

A Knowledge Base explains **how the system works**. A runbook answers a different question: **what
do I do right now?** The two are not the same document and should not be written the same way. The
KB is read while you think; the runbook is read while something is on fire — by someone who may not
have built this, at an hour when they are not at their best.

That difference drives every rule below: **imperative, exact, and honest about what it doesn't know.**

## Inputs
- **Scope** — one service/app (best), or a module. A runbook for "everything" helps nobody; if the
  repo holds several deployables, ask which one, or produce one file per service.
- `knowledge-base/` — required for the business half. Missing → say so and point at `/namht-scan`;
  you can still produce the operational half from config, at lower confidence.

## Where the evidence comes from
Read **both** halves, and cite files for everything:

| Section | Ground it in |
|---|---|
| What this service is, who it serves | KB `04-business-domain`, `06-modules`, `01-project-structure` |
| Dependencies that can take it down | KB `14-integrations`, `17-async-events`, `08-database-schema` |
| Deploy / rollback | `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `Dockerfile`, k8s manifests, `helm/`, `terraform/`, `Procfile`, deploy scripts in `package.json`/`Makefile` |
| Health & readiness | actual health endpoints in the code, k8s probes, load-balancer config |
| Config & secrets | `.env.example`, config classes, secret **names** (never values) |
| Failure modes | KB `15-error-scenarios`, plus real `catch`/`rescue`/error branches, retry/timeout settings, circuit breakers, DLQ config |
| Data recovery | migration tool (Flyway/Prisma/Liquibase), backup config, queue redrive settings |
| Alerts | monitoring config in the repo, log/metric names actually emitted |

## Procedure
1. **Pick the scope and name the service** the way the team says it out loud, not the folder name.
2. **Harvest the operational facts** from the table above. When two sources disagree (the README
   says one deploy command, CI does another), **believe the CI config** and note the discrepancy —
   a stale README is exactly how a runbook gets someone into trouble.
3. **Build the failure catalogue from what this system really does.** Do not paste a generic list.
   Every incident entry must trace to something concrete: an integration that can time out, a queue
   with a DLQ, a migration that isn't backward-compatible, an auth dependency, a rate limit, a
   scheduled job. If the code cannot fail that way, leave it out.
4. **Write each playbook as steps someone can execute**, in this shape:
   ```
   ### Symptom: orders stop appearing, queue depth climbing
   Likely cause · Consumer is failing and messages are landing in the DLQ.
   1. Confirm     — <exact command / dashboard / query>            → you should see …
   2. Contain     — <the safe first action: scale, disable a flag, pause the consumer>
   3. Diagnose    — <where the error is logged; what to grep for>
   4. Fix         — <the action>            ⚠ DESTRUCTIVE / needs approval: <yes|no>
   5. Verify      — <how you know it worked, an actual check not a feeling>
   6. If it fails — escalate to <role>, and capture <what> for the postmortem
   ```
5. **Mark what only a human knows — do not guess it.** Owners, on-call rotation, phone numbers,
   SLA/SLO targets, business escalation, maintenance windows, whether an action needs sign-off.
   These belong in a short **"Fill this in"** block at the top of the section that needs them.
   A fabricated escalation path is worse than an empty one: someone will follow it.
6. **Flag every dangerous action explicitly** — anything that deletes data, replays a queue,
   restarts production, rolls back a migration, or touches money. Mark it `⚠ DESTRUCTIVE`, say what
   it cannot be undone from, and state who must approve. **Never run these yourself** — this skill
   writes a document, it does not operate anything.
7. **Verify the commands you wrote are real.** Every command must come from a file you read (cite
   it). If you inferred one, label it `UNVERIFIED — confirm before relying on this`. A runbook full
   of plausible-looking commands that don't exist is the failure mode to avoid.

## Output (dual-audience; save + render HTML)
Save to `namht-sessions/runbook/<service>-<date>.md`, render with the bundled renderer, and open it.
Resolve this skill's `references/` dir first (call it `$SKILL_DIR`):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/namht-runbook/references` if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set, else the
`references/` folder next to this SKILL.md, else `$HOME/.claude/skills/namht-runbook/references`.
```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/render-html.cjs" <md> <html> "Runbook — <service>"
```

```
# Runbook — <service>

## In plain words (for anyone, including non-engineers)
What this service does, what users lose when it is down, and how urgent that is.

## Fill this in (owner-only — the tool cannot know these)
| Field | Value |
| Service owner / team | ❓ |
| On-call channel & rotation | ❓ |
| Severity ladder & SLA | ❓ |
| Business escalation (who decides on customer impact) | ❓ |

## Service card
Purpose · criticality · runtime & where it runs · upstream/downstream dependencies · data stores ·
queues/topics · scheduled jobs. Each with a file citation.

## Before you touch anything
Access you need · which environment is which · the read-only checks that are always safe.

## Is it healthy?
The exact checks, in order, with what a good answer looks like.

## Deploy · rollback
Normal deploy · how to roll back · how long it takes · what rollback does NOT undo
(migrations, consumed messages, sent emails) — this line matters more than the rest.

## Incident playbooks
One per real failure mode, in the Symptom/Confirm/Contain/Diagnose/Fix/Verify/Escalate shape.

## Alerts → what to do
| Alert / log signature | Means | First action | Playbook |

## Data & recovery
Migrations (forward + backward) · DLQ / redrive · backups & restore · reconciliation jobs.
Mark destructive steps.

## Known gaps
What could not be determined from the repo, and who could answer it. Be specific — this list is
the to-do that makes the next version of this runbook better.
```

Also append one row to `namht-sessions/runbook/_journal.md`
(`| Date | Service | Playbooks | Gaps | Source commit |`) so it is visible when a runbook is aging.

## Where it should live (ask, don't assume)
A runbook is useless if nobody can find it during an incident. Offer, in order: the team's wiki/
Confluence (paste-ready), `RUNBOOK.md` in the service repo, or the KB hub if one exists
(`scripts/kb-export.sh`). **Writing into a team repo needs the user's explicit OK** — this kit's
default is zero footprint in repos you don't own.

## Rules
- **Never invent a command, endpoint, dashboard, alert name, owner or phone number.** Cite the file,
  or mark it `UNVERIFIED`, or leave a `❓`. This is the whole difference between a runbook and a
  liability.
- **Never put secrets in it** — name the variable and where it lives, never the value. Runbooks get
  pasted into chat during incidents.
- **This skill writes; it does not operate.** No deploying, restarting, replaying, or migrating.
- **Prefer the safe action first.** Every playbook contains a containment step before a fix step —
  in an incident, stopping the bleeding beats being right.
- **Say when a failure mode has no known fix.** "We don't have a procedure for this" is real
  information; an invented procedure is not.
- Keep it short enough to be read under stress: imperative sentences, no essays, tables over prose.
