  Make a service answerable in production — add structured logging, a correlation

  context rich enough to group by. Emits fields that match the team's Splunk schema
  so queries and dashboards actually work. Use when the user says "/observe", "add

  service to be queryable/monitorable. Edits code — change-discipline applies.

# namht-observe — instrument a service so it can be debugged from the outside

When something breaks at 3am you don't have the code in front of you — you have logs, metrics and a
trace ID. This skill puts those in place so a service can be diagnosed **without** re-reading its
source. It is the producer side of `/namht-splunk-report`: instrument the right fields here, query
them there.

## Ground it first
- Read the target flow in the KB (`03-entry-points`, `10-core-flows`, `14-integrations`,
  `12-conventions`) and the real code. Follow the **existing** logging library/format — never
  introduce a second logging style.
- Learn the **downstream schema** and emit its exact field names. If the team's Splunk uses
  `cai_app` / `cai_enviroment`, those are the field keys you write — not `app` / `env`.

## The instrumentation model (what "good" looks like)
**One correlation ID, end to end.** Generate it at the edge (HTTP filter / first consumer), carry it
through every log line, and **propagate it across service hops**:
- HTTP: read/set `X-Request-Id` (or W3C `traceparent`); pass it on outbound calls.
- **SQS/async:** put it in the message's `MessageAttributes` on send; the consumer reads it back and
  re-establishes it before doing any work. This is the piece most teams miss — without it, a request
  becomes untraceable the moment it crosses a queue.

**Structured events, not prose.** Log key=value / JSON at meaningful boundaries only: request/message
**entry**, each **external call** (DB / HTTP / queue) with outcome + duration, notable **decisions**,
**errors**, and the **result**. A consistent field set per service (service, env, correlation id,
operation, outcome, duration_ms, plus the error fields below).

**Error context you can aggregate.** On failure log: exception **class**, message, stack, the
correlation ID, and the (masked) inputs that triggered it. Stable `error_type` field → lets
`/namht-splunk-report` collapse thousands of messages into a handful of error signatures.

**The four golden signals as metrics.** Latency, traffic (throughput), errors (by type), saturation
(pool/queue depth, consumer lag for SQS). Prefer one standard (OpenTelemetry) so it's uniform across
the polyglot fleet.

## Stack notes (match what the service already uses)
- **Java / Spring:** SLF4J + Logback with **MDC** for the correlation ID (set in a servlet filter /
  Camel processor / `@SqsListener`); JSON via `logstash-logback-encoder`; Micrometer for metrics.
- **Ruby on Rails:** tagged logging / Lograge or `semantic_logger` for structured lines; set the
  correlation tag in middleware and in the Shoryuken/Sidekiq worker.
- **Node:** `pino`/`winston` structured JSON; carry the id via `AsyncLocalStorage`; set it in the
  Express middleware and the `sqs-consumer` handler.
- **Apache Camel:** instrument routes at `from`/`to`; propagate the id via exchange headers → SQS attributes.

## Method
1. **Audit** current instrumentation: structured or prose, levels, gaps, noise, and any
   **secret/PII leakage** into logs (flag and fix immediately).
2. Propose a small **field schema + instrumentation plan** (what fields, where, which metrics). Show it, get an OK.
3. Apply with change-discipline (scope-locked, minimal diff, match conventions, verify build/tests, rollback if red).
4. Report the **new queryable fields/metrics** + 2–3 example Splunk queries the instrumentation unlocks.

## Output (dual-audience; save + report)
Chat summary + `namht-sessions/observe/<area>-<date>.md`: the field schema, what changed where,
and example queries/dashboards it enables.

## Rules
- **Never log secrets or PII** (tokens, passwords, full PANs, raw emails) — mask/redact at the log call.
- **Match the downstream field names exactly** so existing queries/dashboards keep working.
- **Signal over noise** — instrument boundaries/decisions/errors, right level, sane cardinality (no unbounded label values).
- Logging/metrics are **side-effect-free**: they must never alter business logic or throw.
- **Prove it fires — instrumentation without an assertion is a hope.** Add at least one test per
  instrumented boundary: (a) an entry→exit test asserting the log line carries the correlation id and
  the required schema fields; (b) for async, a produce→consume test asserting the id survives the SQS
  `MessageAttributes` hop and is re-established by the consumer; (c) a redaction test asserting a
  payload containing a secret/PII field is emitted **masked**. A correlation id that dies at a queue
  hop or a mask that doesn't mask fails silently and only surfaces at 3am. Also confirm existing
  log-parsing tests/dashboards still match any field name you changed.
- **Safety net — before the first edit.** `git status --porcelain` (ask the user to commit/stash first)
  and save `git diff HEAD > <session>/00-pre-change.patch`. To undo use ONLY `git stash push -u` or
  `git apply -R <your diff>` — the git-guard denies `git restore`, `git checkout .`/`--`,
  `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`.
- Change-discipline: minimal diff, verify + rollback, confirm outward actions, never touch secrets.

## Common rationalizations

| What you'll tell yourself | What's actually true |
|---|---|
| "I'll add the correlation id later" | Without it the logs are a pile of unrelated lines, which is most of the value gone. It is the part that must not be deferred. |
| "More logging is better" | Logging at the wrong level, in a hot loop, or with a payload in it costs money and buries the one line that mattered. Fewer, better-shaped events. |
| "I'll just log the object" | That is how customer data and tokens end up in a log aggregator that a whole org can search. Log field names and ids, never raw payloads. |
| "It emits, so it works" | Emitting is not the same as being queryable. If the field names don't match the team's schema, no dashboard will ever find them. |

## Red flags

- A log line that contains a whole request/response object.
- Field names invented here that don't match what the rest of the services emit.
- A trace id that stops at a queue boundary.
- Instrumentation added but never triggered once to see what comes out.

## Verification

- [ ] Field names match the project's existing schema — checked against real emitted logs, not memory.
- [ ] A correlation id flows across **every** hop, including async ones.
- [ ] You triggered the path and **read the actual output** — it is not assumed to work.
- [ ] No secrets, tokens or personal data in any emitted field.
- [ ] Error events carry enough context to group by, not just a message.
