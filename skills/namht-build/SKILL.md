  Implement a feature or change end-to-end with a disciplined spec-driven
  pipeline: clarify → size → plan (impact + business flow) → safety net → generate code →
  independent multi-lens review → tests (incl. regression) → verify against a baseline →
  evidence report → update the Knowledge Base → hand off. Use when the user asks to "build",
  "implement", "add a feature", "/build", or wants a production-ready change that respects the
  existing architecture and business rules. Reads the repo's knowledge-base/ for grounding.

# Spec Build — implementation pipeline

A native port of Auto Spec Kit's `/build`. The goal: turn one requirement into a
**production-ready, architecture-conformant, tested** change — not a quick draft.
You (Claude Code) are the engine; use your own tools instead of an external model:
`Read/Grep/Glob` to investigate, the `Task` tool to fan out parallel specialist
sub-agents, `Edit/Write` to apply code, and `Bash` to run tests.

## Inputs — a story/plan is the spec; read it and run
If the user points at a story or plan — a path, a session folder, a story id (`US-F1-001`), a Jira/
Slack/doc link, or pasted text — **read it yourself and build from it.** Its acceptance criteria are
**already the user's decision: treat them as confirmed, reuse their ids verbatim, and do NOT ask for
re-approval.** For a link the tools can't open (Jira/Figma/Notion), say so once and ask for the content
— don't guess what's behind it.
If no artifact was named, still Glob `spec-kit-sessions/{user-stories,plans,discovery,plan-reviews,qa}/`
for one matching this requirement and offer it. Also skim `builds/_journal.md` and `answers/_journal.md`
(ground rule 1). Only when there is genuinely no story do you author the ACs yourself (Step 0).

## Ground rules (apply to every step)
0. **Investigate with Read/Grep/Glob + the KB.** Map the relevant code with Grep/Glob/Read and the
   `knowledge-base/`. For the Step 1 impact/blast-radius, **grep for the callers** of the symbols you
   will change (and, across services, consult the Event/Contract Catalog — see Step 1).
1. **Ground everything in the Knowledge Base.** Load `knowledge-base/` from the repo
   (especially `04-business-domain`, `05-domain-model`, `10-core-flows`,
   `13-business-rules`, `12-conventions`, `16-architecture-patterns`, `review-skills.md`).
   Also skim `spec-kit-sessions/answers/_journal.md` and `builds/_journal.md` if present — past Q&A
   conclusions and past builds in this area often carry decisions the KB doesn't (cheap: two small indexes).
   If `knowledge-base/` is missing, tell the user to run `/namht-scan` first, or
   proceed with reduced confidence using direct code reading.
2. **Do NOT break the existing design.** New code MUST follow the documented
   architectural style, layer/dependency rules, and the "Architecture Invariants —
   DO NOT BREAK" list in `16-architecture-patterns.md`. Copy the matching Extension Recipe.
3. **Reuse before you create — MANDATORY.** Before designing anything new, search the repo for what
   already does the job: existing **functions/methods, classes/services, helpers/utils, UI components,
   hooks/middleware, DTOs/models, and equally the small things that get duplicated most —
   constants/enums, config keys, error codes, validation & user-facing messages, i18n keys, design
   tokens/styles, test fixtures/factories** — search by *capability*, not just by name (grep several
   synonyms, read the module's siblings, check `06-modules` / `16-architecture-patterns` in the KB).
   Also check the
   **already-installed libraries** (`package.json` / `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` / `Gemfile` /
   `requirements.txt`) before reaching for a new one. **If something suitable exists you MUST reuse or
   extend it** — do not re-implement it. Create something new ONLY when nothing suitable exists, and then
   record the one-line justification ("searched X, Y, Z — nothing fits because …"). **Never add a new
   dependency** when an installed library already covers the need; if a new one is genuinely required,
   say why and get the user's OK first.
4. **Cite real paths and names.** No invented files, APIs, or fields.
5. **Match the project's conventions exactly** — naming, error handling, logging, validation placement, test style.
6. **Persist artifacts.** Create a session folder
   `spec-kit-sessions/builds/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS>-<slug>/` and save each phase's output there
   (`01-plan/plan.md`, `01-plan/baseline.md`, `03-code/change.diff`, `04-code-review/review.md`,
   `05-tests/`, `07-evidence/EVIDENCE.md`, `README.md`). Keep artifacts as **pointers and diffs**, not
   copies of file contents — the repo and git are the audit trail.
7. **Stop and ask** before doing something destructive or ambiguous. Prefer a TodoList
   (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate) so the user can follow the pipeline.
8. **Scale rigor to risk, not to ceremony.** Follow the Step 0.5 size classification: spend agents and
   artifacts where a mistake is expensive, and don't run the full apparatus for a one-line change.

## Change discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE — read before editing anything)
This is what keeps the tool from "breaking the project" or making rambling edits:
- **Scope lock.** Edit ONLY the files in the approved plan. If you discover another change is
  needed, STOP and add it to the plan (or ask) — do not silently expand scope.
- **Minimal diff.** Make the smallest change that satisfies the requirement. NO drive-by
  refactors, renames, reformatting, import reordering, or "while I'm here" cleanups in files
  you're touching for another reason. Match the surrounding style exactly.
- **Preserve behavior.** Never delete or rewrite existing logic unless the task requires it and
  the plan says so. If you must change a shared function, check its blast radius first
  (grep for its callers) and update every caller intentionally.
- **No structure churn.** Don't move files, change the folder layout, swap libraries, or alter
  build/config/CI unless explicitly requested. Follow the existing architecture (rule 2).
- **Plan-approval gate — objective triggers.** Show the plan and get an explicit "go" before writing
  code if ANY of these is true (don't judge "trivial" by feel):
  a DB/schema migration · adding or upgrading a dependency · a change to a **published API / event /
  message contract**, or any cross-service consumer found in Step 1 §2 · touching a shared symbol with
  **>3 callers** · **>5 files** to change · the Step 1 §7 estimate is **Medium/Complex** · anything
  touching auth/permissions or money. Below all of those, you may proceed — but still post the scope,
  file list and ACs first.
- **A blanket "go" has limits.** "build X, go" in the opening request authorizes the **reversible**
  work only. It never covers migrations, dependency additions, published-contract changes, deletions,
  or anything outward — **stop and ask for those even if the user said go.**
- **Shared contracts & schema go through migrate discipline.** If the change touches a DB schema, a
  published API/event shape, or any contract another deployable consumes, apply the
  **expand → migrate → contract** pattern from `namht-migrate` (additive first, backfill, only then
  remove/tighten; every step reversible; a deprecation window for consumers). Never do a
  rename-in-place or a destructive migration inside a build — hand it to `/namht-migrate` if it's the
  bulk of the work.
- **Don't leave the tree broken.** After edits, the project must still build/lint/typecheck and
  tests must pass (Step 11). If your change makes it red and you can't fix it quickly, **revert
  using the Step 3.5 safety net** rather than leaving broken code.
- **Confirm before irreversible/outward actions.** Deleting files, DB migrations, **breaking a
  published API/event contract**, `git push`, installing dependencies, or anything network/outbound —
  ask first. Respect untrusted workspaces.
- **Never touch secrets.** Don't read, print, move, or commit `.env`, keys, or credentials.
- **Git: don't push as part of a build; read/sync-in only.** Use `git` for fetch, pull, status,
  log, diff, show, blame, **stash**, **apply** (and local `add`/`commit` when the user asks). Do not
  `push` during a build, and never run destructive git (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`,
  `checkout --`/`.`, `restore`, `rebase`, `branch -D`, `commit --amend`). A harness git-guard hook
  enforces this. Don't work around it; if unsure, ask the user.

## Step 0 — Clarify (gate) — **answer from evidence first, ask only what's left**
Do the homework before you spend the user's attention. For every open question, try in this order:
**the story/plan → the KB (`04-business-domain`, `05-domain-model`, `10-core-flows`,
`13-business-rules`, `12-conventions`, `16-architecture-patterns`) → the actual code → the journals**.
Most "questions" are already answered there — an existing entity, an established convention, a
documented rule. Resolve them silently and **state the answer with its source** instead of asking.

Only ask when **all three** hold: the evidence genuinely doesn't decide it, the choice would change
what you build (not just how you phrase it), and getting it wrong would be expensive to undo. Then ask
**everything at once, max 2–4 questions**, each with your recommended default so a "ok, go with your
defaults" is a valid answer. Never ask something the KB already answers.

**Acceptance criteria.**
- **From a story/plan** → already confirmed. Restate them for the record and move on; don't re-ask.
- **Authored by you** (no story) → write them Given/When/Then, numbered `AC-01…`, mark which ones you
  *inferred*, and get one quick yes — they are the pass bar for Steps 5, 7 and 12, so validating
  against your own unreviewed guess is the one confirmation worth its cost. If the user pre-authorized
  ("go"), post them and proceed unless they object — but still flag any inference you're unsure about.

Then restate the final requirement and its ACs in one short block.

## Step 0.5 — Size the change (gate)
Classify from the Step 0 restatement plus a quick grep — this decides how much apparatus runs:
- **L (large/risky)** — ANY of: auth/permissions, money/billing, a DB migration, a published
  API/event contract, a shared symbol with no test coverage, or >5 files.
  → the full pipeline: 3 planning agents, all 6 review lenses as independent agents, all test angles.
- **M (normal feature)** — a self-contained feature in one module, 2–5 files.
  → plan with the sections that apply, 1–2 planning agents, the review lenses that can find something
  (always Business consistency + Reuse), all test angles.
- **S (small/mechanical)** — a copy/config/field change, ≤2 files, no contract or schema impact.
  → **skip the agent fan-out and the 8-section plan**: state scope + file list + ACs in chat, make the
  change, add/extend a test, run the gates, and write a short EVIDENCE section. Still obey the change
  discipline and the safety net.
Say which size you picked and why (one line). When in doubt, size **up**.

## Step 1 — Planning (multi-agent)
Discover the relevant files (Grep/Glob + KB topic match), then fan out **parallel sub-agents** via the
`Task` tool (`agents/namht-codebase-analyzer`, `namht-impact-detector`, `namht-business-flow-tracer`).
If you don't spawn agents, do the analyses yourself in sequence.

**Sub-agent hand-off contract (applies to every Task call in this skill).** Sub-agents start with no
context and will otherwise re-discover the repo from scratch — expensive and inconsistent. Every Task
prompt must carry: (a) the restated requirement + confirmed ACs, (b) **the exact file list you already
found, with paths**, (c) which KB docs to read (paths, not "the KB"), (d) the precise question you want
answered and the output shape, (e) what is out of scope. Tell them not to re-scan the whole repo.

Synthesize a **comprehensive implementation plan**:
1. **Requirement Analysis** — scope (do / don't), the confirmed ACs from Step 0, edge cases.
2. **Impact Analysis** — files that MUST change, downstream consumers (trace the blast radius via real
   imports/callers), API-contract changes, DB impact/migrations, breaking changes, side effects,
   **cross-service impact** (if the change alters a published message / SQS topic / REST contract, list
   the **consumer services** from the Event/Contract Catalog — `17-async-events.md` or the workspace
   `system-map/` — plus async hazards: duplicate/idempotency, ordering, DLQ, schema/version skew),
   and a risk matrix `| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |`.
3. **Business Flow Mapping** — existing flows affected (before→after), new flow step-by-step, state-machine changes.
4. **Technical Design** — modules/layers affected, files to MODIFY, files to CREATE (full paths following
   existing patterns), and a mandatory **Reuse Report** that justifies every new artifact:
   `| Capability needed | Existing candidate (real path) | Decision: reuse / extend / new | Why |`
   Every row marked **new** must name the searches you ran and why nothing fitted; a new dependency goes
   in this table too and needs the user's OK.
5. **Rollout & Reversibility** — is a feature flag needed (default value, who flips it, when it's
   removed)? deploy order (migration ↔ code) and what breaks if only half is deployed? behavior under
   **version skew** during a rolling deploy? how to undo in production (flag off / revert / down-migration)?
   New config/env vars and where they're set. Data backfill, if any.
6. **Implementation Steps** — ordered by dependency, as a checklist.
7. **Estimate** — complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex) + rough time. (Feeds the plan-approval gate.)
8. **Architecture Conformance** — which documented pattern the target module uses; the specific
   "Architecture Invariants — DO NOT BREAK" that apply, and how the plan honors each.

**Breaking-change gate.** If §2 lists any breaking change to a shared contract (removed/renamed/retyped
field or endpoint, dropped/renamed column, changed published message shape), STOP: present it, apply
expand→contract, and confirm with the user before coding — regardless of any earlier "go".

Save to `01-plan/plan.md`. **Do not write code yet.**

## Steps 2–3 — Plan review & feedback
Review the plan against a fixed challenge list — delegate to `/namht-plan-review`, or spawn ONE
adversarial sub-agent that answers: which AC is unmeasurable? which "Architecture Invariant" is at
risk? which Reuse Report row marked `new` is unjustified? which consumer in §2 has no mitigation?
what's missing from Rollout & Reversibility? Record the answers and the fixes in `01-plan/plan.md`
(a "Plan review" section) — a review with no written finding and no diff is not a review.
For a change that hit the plan-approval gate, show the final plan to the user and get a thumbs-up.

## Step 3.5 — Safety net (MUST complete before the first edit)
Both "compare against a baseline" (Step 11) and "revert" (change discipline) are impossible without
this, and the git commands that would otherwise undo your work are blocked by the git-guard.
1. **Clean tree.** Run `git status --porcelain`. If the user has uncommitted work, ask them to commit
   or stash first — you must not risk their changes.
2. **Baseline the gates.** Run the narrowest relevant gates once (typecheck/lint + the test files
   covering the target module — not necessarily the whole suite) and record pass/fail plus **the names
   of tests already failing** into `01-plan/baseline.md`. If the repo is already red, say so now: those
   failures are not yours to fix.
3. **Snapshot.** Save `git diff HEAD > 00-pre-change.patch` in the session folder and note the base
   commit SHA.
**How to revert later (only these are allowed):** `git stash push -u` to park everything, or
`git apply -R 03-code/change.diff` to reverse exactly your own change. Never `git restore`,
`git checkout .`/`--`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f` — the guard denies them.

## Step 4 — Code generation
Implement the plan. For multi-module changes, split work by module/layer (optionally
parallel sub-agents, using the hand-off contract) and assemble. **Apply changes directly to the repo
with Edit/Write.** Rules: complete, production-ready code (no placeholders/TODOs); follow the REFERENCE
patterns; respect layer/dependency rules and the architecture invariants; correct imports, types, error
handling; match `12-conventions.md`.

**Re-check reuse at the moment you write, not just when you planned.** Immediately before creating any
new symbol — a method, class/service, component, DTO, **constant/enum, config key, error code,
validation or user-facing message, i18n key, style/design token, test fixture** — do a quick grep for
an existing one (by capability and by a couple of synonyms) and **open the nearest sibling file to copy
its pattern**: same layer placement, naming, error-handling shape, logging, validation location,
test style. If something suitable exists, **use or extend it — do not write a parallel version**, and
never introduce a second constant/message/token for a value the repo already defines. If the plan's
Reuse Report said "new" but you now find an existing candidate, follow the code, not the plan, and note
the correction. Stay inside the planned files: no wandering edits, no speculative helpers "for later".

## Step 5 — Code review (independent, multi-lens)
**Author ≠ reviewer.** Run the lenses as **fresh `Task` sub-agents that did not write the code**. Give
each one only the diff (`git diff`), the KB docs it needs, and the plan's ACs + Reuse Report — **not
your reasoning** — and instruct it adversarially: *"find where this diverges from the plan, the ACs, or
an architecture invariant."* All lenses use `knowledge-base/review-skills.md`, falling back to the
bundled `references/review-skills-universal.md`.
- **Security** → `agents/namht-security-reviewer` — input validation, injection, authn/authz, data exposure, crypto/secrets.
- **Architecture & pattern conformance** → `agents/namht-architecture-reviewer` — does it violate an "Architecture Invariant"? same pattern as the surrounding module? forbidden dependency direction? Quote the rule broken.
- **Performance** → `agents/namht-performance-reviewer` — N+1 queries, missing indexes, memory leaks, blocking/sequential calls, missing pagination/caching.
- **Business consistency** → `agents/namht-business-consistency-reviewer` — rules intact, no logic silently removed, valid state transitions, API contract preserved, **every AC implemented**.
- **Reuse & duplication** — did this re-implement something the repo already has (helper, service, component, validator, mapper, **constant/enum, config key, error code, message, i18n key, style token, test fixture**) instead of reusing it? Does it follow the pattern of its sibling files, or invent a parallel style? Did it add a dependency an installed library already covers? Check the plan's **Reuse Report** against what was actually written; flag violations `[MAJOR]` and replace the duplicate with the existing one.
- **Operability** — does the new path emit a structured log with the correlation id, and errors with
  enough context to group on? Do new external/queue calls have timeout + retry/backoff, and are
  consumers/endpoints **idempotent** under retry? Are new failure modes visible (metric/alert)? Match
  the fields `namht-observe` and the team's log schema use. *(For UI changes also check: no hardcoded
  user-facing strings if the repo has an i18n catalog; new interactive elements have accessible
  names/labels, keyboard reachability, visible focus.)*

Produce a merged review with deduplicated issues (each: severity `[CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR]`,
exact location, bad code, complete fixed code), strengths, a verdict (APPROVED /
NEEDS_REVISION), and a quality score X/10. Save to `04-code-review/review.md`.

## Step 6 — Code feedback
Apply every `[CRITICAL]` and high-risk `[MAJOR]` fix from the review. Re-verify until the
verdict is APPROVED (or remaining items are explicitly accepted by the user).

## Step 7 — Write tests (multi-angle)
Write tests covering these angles (do them yourself, or spin up parallel sub-agents — one per angle —
then merge). **Every AC must map to ≥1 named test**; list the mapping (`AC-03 → test name`) — an AC with
no test is an open gap, not a pass.
- **Unit** — every public function/method; mock dependencies; happy path + return + side effects; name pattern `should [behavior] when [condition]`.
- **Integration** — API request→response, auth (401/403), validation (400), service composition, DB, full business flows.
- **Edge cases & security** — boundary values, null/undefined, concurrency/duplicates, error propagation, permission bypass, invalid state transitions, malicious input.
- **Regression (old flow)** — one test per impacted caller/consumer/flow from Step 1 §2's blast radius,
  asserting the **OLD behavior still holds**. Label `[REGRESSION]` and cite the KB flow/rule it protects
  (e.g. BR-V2 / core-flow #3). This is what turns the impact analysis into a safety net instead of prose.

Start with a coverage table, then the test files. Save to `05-tests/` and apply them to the repo.

## Steps 8–9 — Test review & feedback
Review the tests against a fixed list and write the findings down: does each test **fail on the
pre-change code** (or is it asserting nothing)? independent and deterministic? mocking only at
boundaries? meaningful assertions? Fix the gaps, finalize.

## Step 10 — Save files
Ensure all code + test files are written to the correct paths in the repo. Confirm the file list, and
save the change as a diff: `git diff > 03-code/change.diff` (this is also your reverse-patch).

## Step 11 — Verify (build + lint + typecheck + tests) with rollback
Prove you didn't break the project. Run the same gates you baselined in Step 3.5 via `Bash`
(in an untrusted workspace, ask before running):
- **Build / typecheck**: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `go build ./...`, `mvn -q compile`, etc.
- **Lint**: `eslint`, `ruff`, `golangci-lint`, `rubocop` — only if the project already uses it.
- **Tests**: from `package.json` scripts, `pytest`, `go test`, `mvn/gradle`, `Gemfile`, etc.

**Compare against `01-plan/baseline.md`** — a test that was already failing before you started is not
your regression; a gate that was green and is now red is.
- If tests/build fail: loop back → diagnose → fix → re-run (a few iterations).
- **A test may be changed here ONLY if the test itself is wrong** (bad fixture, wrong expected value,
  flaky setup). **Never delete, skip, or weaken an assertion to reach green.** Any test you edit in this
  step must be listed in the evidence report with the reason.
- **Code changed after Step 5 gets re-reviewed** — re-run the relevant lens on the new diff; fixes made
  under time pressure are exactly where defects hide.
- **If you can't get it green within a few iterations, REVERT** via the Step 3.5 safety net
  (`git stash push -u` or `git apply -R 03-code/change.diff`), verify with `git status --porcelain` +
  a re-run of the baseline gates, and state plainly *"reverted — tree matches baseline"* or list every
  file you could not restore. Never hand back broken code as "done".
- **If a gate cannot be run at all** (no test script, framework missing, needs services that aren't up,
  Bash unavailable/untrusted workspace): name the gate and why, write `NOT RUN (<reason>)` — never a
  pass — in the evidence header, mark the change **UNVERIFIED** in both EVIDENCE.md and the chat
  summary, and tell the user exactly what to run. Silence here is how unverified code ships.
Only report success for gates that actually ran and passed.

## Step 12 — Evidence report
Write `07-evidence/EVIDENCE.md` with: a header table (requirement, session, date, test status —
including `NOT RUN` where applicable, coverage); Implementation Summary; Files Changed table;
**Acceptance Criteria Verification** table (each AC → ✅/❌ → **the named test** that proves it, not
prose); Business Flow Validation; Test Results (vs baseline); any test edited in Step 11 + why; Code
Quality score; Risk Assessment (reference the plan's matrix — don't restate it); Rollout notes from
plan §5; Known Limitations & Next Steps. Also write the session `README.md` with quick links.

Then append ONE row to `spec-kit-sessions/builds/_journal.md` (create with this header if missing) so a
future session — and `/namht-ask` — can find what was built and why:
```markdown
# Build Journal — one line per build (newest last)
| Date | Requirement | Outcome (what changed + key decision) | Session folder |
|---|---|---|---|
```

## Step 13 — Update the Knowledge Base
Reflect the change back into `knowledge-base/` by running the **`/namht-rescan` procedure scoped to the
files this session changed** (use the Step 10 file list, or the Step 3.5 base SHA as the diff base) —
rescan owns the authoritative change→doc mapping (domain model, DB schema, entry points, API, flows,
rules, auth, integrations, async events, structure, and the **Mermaid high-level diagram in
`07-architecture-diagram.md`** when the topology changed) and the golden rules in `kb-steps.md`.
Then append any new project-specific rule discovered during review to **Section 14** of
`review-skills.md`. Keep the KB accurate so the next build is smarter.

**In-repo docs the team actually reads.** The KB is personal and gitignored, so also update any doc
that lives in the repo and that this change made stale: the committed API spec
(`openapi.yaml` / `*.proto` / GraphQL SDL), the README section describing this feature, a CHANGELOG
entry if the project keeps one, and `.env.example` when you added config. These are part of the change.

## Step 14 — Handoff
Name the next steps explicitly (don't dead-end):
- `/namht-qa <story>` — turn the ACs into an executable test plan, including regression for the flows
  named in `01-plan/plan.md` §2 (pass the session path).
- `/namht-qa-integration <url>` — verify the feature on a running app.
- `/namht-review` — an independent second-pass review of the whole change.
- `/namht-pr` — draft the PR description from the branch.
- `/namht-migrate` — if the Breaking-change gate deferred a contract/schema change.

## Final
Summarize for the user: what changed, size class, test status + coverage (or `UNVERIFIED` + why), the
session folder path, rollout notes, and any follow-ups. Be honest if tests were skipped or failing —
never claim success you didn't verify.
